# 📚 Library Management System

## ✅ Objective
Create a system to allow users to search books by title using **linear search** and **binary search** algorithms.

## 🔍 Understanding: Search Algorithms

### 🔹 Linear Search
- Scans each item in sequence.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Usage**: Works on both sorted and unsorted arrays.

### 🔹 Binary Search
- Works by repeatedly dividing the sorted list in half.
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
- **Usage**: Works only on **sorted** arrays.
