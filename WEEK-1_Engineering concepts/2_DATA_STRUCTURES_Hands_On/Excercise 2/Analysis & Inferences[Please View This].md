# 🔎 E-Commerce Search Function — Java

This project implements **Linear** and **Binary Search** to explore that!

## 🧠 Big O in Simple Words

- **Big O Notation** tells us how algorithms grow as input size increases.
- We care about **Best**, **Average**, and **Worst Case**:
    - Best: Found instantly `O(1)`
    - Average: Midway search `O(n/2)` or `O(log n)`
    - Worst: Last item or not found `O(n)` or `O(log n)`

## 🧪 Search Algorithms Used 🔁 Linear Search

🔍 Linear Search (Check each item one-by-one)

✅ No sorting needed

❌ Slower for large arrays

Time: O(n)


🔍 Binary Search (Split and conquer)

✅ Very fast on sorted data

❌ Needs sorted input

Time: O(log n)

## ⚖️ Which is Better?

Feature	Linear Search	Binary Search
Speed	Slower	✅ Much Faster
Sorting Need	❌ No	✅ Yes (before search)
Real-world Use	Small data	✅ Large datasets

✅ Binary Search is best for e-commerce platforms where product lists are large and performance matters.
